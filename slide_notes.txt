Sysadmins have to configure stuff
    We spend hours upon hours reading the friendly manuals, watching youtube videos, reading quickstarts and tutorials.
    A lot of what we owe our expertise to is the ability to google better than the next person.
    So we end up with the responsibility to maintain and configure infrastructure

Keeping track of things is hard
    which system is doing what
    what do we patch when
    which stuff in on prem and what's in the cloud
    How do I join my linux systems to our windows domain again?
    How do we keep track of all the things?

We document!
    Here's a list of effective methods of documenting.
    Shout out to my org mode folks?
    I have used them all, you may have your preferred method.
    But then we are still left with some problems.
    Documentation can drift as the system evolves over time.
    Where do we put all this documentation so it's accessible to the team?
    How do we make the time to document what we are changing?
    How do we keep track of changes to documentation and what that means to systems that are on the old way of doing things vs the new way?
    Personally, I hate documentation for the sake of documentation
    You can't document well if you don't know your audience
    Ideally the audience of my documentation is future me, and I don't know what future me is going to forget
    I know from present me that past me was an idiot and did things in very wonky ways
    So how can I keep all this documentation in a way that future me will thank past me and not think I'm an idiot

Infrastructure as code
    We can write our infrastructure as code and store everything in git
    Using git we can keep track of what changed when and by creating descriptive comments for ourselves
    Just by looking at the source code we can and answer, the what, how, why and who behind every infrastructure change
    And we aren't documenting for the sake of documentation.
    We are describing, in code, the actual system level changes that will modify our configuration
