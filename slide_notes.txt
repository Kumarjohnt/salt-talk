Sysadmins have to configure stuff
    We spend hours upon hours reading the friendly manuals, watching youtube videos, reading quickstarts and tutorials.
    A lot of what we owe our expertice to is the ability to google better than the next person.

Keeping track of things is hard
    which system is doing what
    what do we patch when
    which stuff in on prem and what's in the cloud
    How do I join my linux systems to our windows domain again?
