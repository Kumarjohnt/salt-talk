          I have used them all, you may have your preferred method.<br>
          But then we are still left with some problems.<br>
          Documentation can drift as the system evolves over time.<br>
          Where do we put all this documentation so it's accessible to the team?<br>
          How do we make the time to document what we are changing?<br>
          How do we keep track of changes to documentation and what that means to systems that are on the old way of doing things vs the new way?<br>
          Personally, I hate documentation for the sake of documentation.<br>
          You can't document well if you don't know your audience.<br>
          Ideally the audience of my documentation is future me, and I don't know what future me is going to forget.<br>
          I know from present me that past me was an idiot and did things in very wonky ways.<br>
          So how can I keep all this documentation in a way that future me will thank past me and not think I'm an idiot.<br>

          We can write our infrastructure as code and store everything in git.<br>
          Using git we can keep track of what changed when and by creating descriptive comments for ourselves.<br>
          Just by looking at the source code we can and answer, the who, what, where, how, why behind every infrastructure change.<br>
          And we aren't documenting for the sake of documentation.<br>
          We are describing, in code, the actual system level changes that will modify our configuration.<br>

          Saltstack is a client server technology that, by default, runs as root/SYSTEM on the client.<br>
          you can use it to:<br>
          - run commands<br>
          - install software<br>
          - update software<br>
          - get information about systems<br>
          - store information about systems<br>
          - and declare all of this in code as "granular" as you like<br>
          Get used to the salt puns, there are more to come.<br>
          Notice the minions are calling into the master.<br>
          One of the minions is in the "cloud".<br>
          So what does a configuration change look like in saltstack.<br>

          We need to ensure it's installed or not, the "state" of the installation.<br>
          Where are we installing xyz.<br>
          - Maybe specific servers A and C but not B.<br>
          - Or all servers that have a specific attribute like an IP address of 10.200.something.<br>
          Then deploy our state.<br>
          - This is where you would leave a helpful git comment for future you.<br>

        <aside class="notes">
          There's some magic happening in the background, the hostname "salt" resolves to the master.<br>
          I do not need to specify the salt master but there is a parameter to do that if you want to name salt something else or run salt over the internet.<br>

        <h3>Accept the keys</h3>
        <img src="assets/accept-keys.png" style="width: 70%;">
        <aside class="notes">
          The minions will accept the master's key by default. If you recreate the master without the a backup of the master's key, the clients won't talk to the master anymore and you'll have to redeploy.<br>
          Now on the master we have to accept the minion's keys, there is mutual authentication occurring here but this exchange is susceptible to MITM so this should be done on a trusted network.<br>
          And if you are running on the internet you don't want to just accept all clients. I plan on putting together some material on evil minions. We'll talk about that later.<br>

          At this point we have an extremely powerful tool. One console with a constant root shell to everything connected to it.<br>

        <h3>Targeting minions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>'server*' = server1 server2 server3 server-fred</li>
          <li>'server?' = server1 server2 server3</li>
          <li>'server[1,3]' = server1 server3</li>
          <li>'server[1-3]' = server1 server2 server3</li>
          <li>-L 'server1,server2'</li>
          <li>-G 'role:worker' = whoever has the grain role=worker</li>
          <li>-S '192.168.0.0/16' = whoever is in the subnet</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Without any switches, the default targeting uses shell style globbing.<br>
          It's customary to surround the target with single quotes so the command doesn't conflict with your shell.<br>
          We can also use lists, grains, subnets and many other methods for targeting.<br>

          Here we have two different state files that demonstrate the same thing.<br>
          The first one is using saltstack's builtin abstraction to the OSes package manager. On debian that's apt, if this was centos it would be yum.<br>
          The second state file is more appropriate to use if the thing you want installed is not in the package manager.<br>
          Since we are working on script and naming things it's a good idea at this point to start tracking changes.<br>

          Pillars are tree-like structures of data defined on the Salt Master and passed through to minions.<br>

          Think of what happens if a minion went evil. If you had to distribute secrets, you wouldn't want all minions knowing all secrets. If you put your secrets in a state file, that's what you are doing. All minions have access to all data in the salt file server. Not so with pillar data.<br>
